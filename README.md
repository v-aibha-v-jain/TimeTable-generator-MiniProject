# 📅 TimeTable Generator - Mini Project

A group project developed as part of an academic mini project.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Manual timetable creation is a **time-consuming** and **error-prone** task in educational institutions. Coordinating class hours, lab schedules, and faculty availability often leads to **conflicts** and **inefficiencies**.

## ✅ Our Solution

The **Automated Timetable Generator** efficiently schedules:
- Classes and labs
- Avoids overlaps
- Distributes subject hours properly
- Respects specific timing constraints

This reduces human effort, enhances accuracy, and saves time - making it ideal for **schools, colleges, and universities**.

## ⚙️ Technologies and Algorithms Used

The system uses a combination of advanced algorithms:
- 🔁 **Backtracking**
- 🧠 **Google OR-Tools**
- 🧬 **Genetic Algorithm**

### ✔️ Features:
- Considers teacher availability and subject load
- Handles lab scheduling rules
- Custom `validate()` function ensures correctness and optimality
- Generates **conflict-free timetables in seconds**
